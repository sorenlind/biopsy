# ðŸ«€ biopsy

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the **biopsy** package, you need to install OpensSide. Since
OpenSlide is not a python package, it is *not* installed automatically when installing
**biopsy**. Instructions for installing OpenSlide can be found here at
<https://openslide.org/download/>. If you're on a Mac, you can install OpenSlide using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as follows:

```zsh
brew install openslide
```

## Installation

```zsh
pip3 install -e .
```
